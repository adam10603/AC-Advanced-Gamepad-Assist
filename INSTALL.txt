To install the mod:
 - Open the "Advanced Gamepad Assist" folder, and copy the "apps" and "extension" folders.
 - Paste the two folders into your main "assettocorsa" folder.

(Optionally, if you have the full / paid version of Content Manager and you know how to use the mods folder, you can install it there instead too.)

Once you've installed the assist, you have to make sure it's active:
 - Open Content Manager, go to Settings on the upper right, then Custom Shaders Patch on the upper left, and Gamepad FX on the left.
 - Make sure Active is checked under Gamepad Script, and select the Advanced Gamepad Assist script.
 - Now go to Settings again, Assetto Corsa on the upper left, then Controls on the left.
 - Here make sure the Input Method is set to Gamepad.

If you want to adjust the steering feel and other features, add the UI app called Advanced Gamepad Assist Config from the side menu in-game!
